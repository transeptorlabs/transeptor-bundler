# Our vision

We are dedicated to advancing the ERC-4337 ecosystem and promoting decentralization in the bundler network.

Our long-term goal is to encourage bundler diversity in the ecosystem and empower others to run their own bundler nodes.

The project's primary focus:

- Run it yourself - Make it easy for anyone to run their own bundler node.
- Promote bundler diversity and reduce centralization risks â€” Transeptor Labs will **never** operate a managed bundler service. Instead, we are committed to decentralization by offering public bundlers anyone can use, and empowering developers to run and customize their own.
- Bundler compatibility - Maintain strict compatibility with [erc-4337/bundler-spec-test](https://www.erc4337.io/bundlers) to preserve vision of a [Unified ERC-4337 mempool](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/unified-erc-4337-mempool).
- Embrace the Future: Experiment safely with advanced features to push bundler UX and performance forward. Any system that can be written down can be realized.
